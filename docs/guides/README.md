# Introduction

Tauri is a security-first and performance conscience framework for building apps. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is at the heart of the framework and handles the backend. The system-based browser drives the frontend enabling OS-level browser patching. This browser, known as the webview, handles the HTML/CSS/JS or other compatible web content. Use the web ecosystem tools to create the web content, and Tauri will bundle it up into a tiny app.
